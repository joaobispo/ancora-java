#summary Steps for starting something related to the repository (ex.: a new Netbeans project).
#labels Phase-Implementation

  * *Starting a new project with Netbeans*
  * *Installing Netbeans*
  * *Creating a Netbeans library*

==Starting a new project with Netbeans==

*Created the basic folder structure*
  * Create /projects/Projectname
  * Create /projects/Projectname/trunk
  * Create /projects/Projectname/trunk/project-netbeansX.Y (where X.Y is the version of Netbeans with which the project is created) 
  * Create /projects/Projectname/trunk/src (for the source files)
  * Create /projects/Projectname/trunk/test (for the unit test files)

*Create folders for Java packages*

  * Create src/org/ancora/projectpackage (several projects may share the same package)
  * Create test/org/ancora/projectpackage



==Installing Netbeans==

*Download the program*
  * Can be downloaded from here: [http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html Netbeans]
  * The Java SE version is enough.

*Installing Subversion binaries (if not present)*

  * Netbeans already has built-in support for Subversion through plugins, but the plugin might not be up-to-date. This can cause problems, as when Subversion went from version 1.5 to 1.6 (Netbeans couldn't execute subversion commands with 1.6 projects).
